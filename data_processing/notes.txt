CONDITIONS
entries with </span> were removed (poor html scraping)
i.e. some drugs do not have conditions
the text instead states the number of people who found the review helpful

the terminal "r" character seems to have been removed
from some of the conditions
(example: ucle instead of ulcer, cance instead of cancer, disorde instead
of disorder)

DRUGS
there are some drug mixtures:
example: Aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide
I'm hoping that the primary component is the first listed, but I can't be sure.
Probably best to removed these completely from the database.
Other weird stuff like XL or 7 / 7 / 7 in the name that isn't going to work
well with a pubchem search.
names like "Todays Health Nasal  Relief Extra Moisturizing" also will not work
in a pubchem search

paper claims 3654 drugs; there are 3671 listed in what I pulled from the raw
data (must have removed some)

in some cases there are drugs that are the same, just different doses
example: Augmentin XR, Augmentin, and Augmentin ES-600, which all show up in
pubchem as the same molecule

there are a lot of drugs where the frequency is 1 (798), so it seems unlikely
that the original data on patient satisfaction will be helpful in predictions
