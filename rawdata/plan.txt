ideas for final project

we have data on pharmaceutical drugs

each data point has:
name of drug
drug target (i.e. disease/condition)
comment on effectiveness (patient review)
rating out of 10
date review was submitted
number of times people thought review was helpful

things I can add:
molecular mass of drug
number of C,H, heteroatoms in drug
fingerprint for drug (openbabel)

we can:
do an analysis to try and predict rating out of 10
or do classification to predict (low <4, med 3< and <8, or high >7)

try to cluster the drugs based on drug target
note: in the paper where the data is presented, they
found that the 5 most frequent disorders were
contraception (38436), depression (12164), anxiety
(7812), and type-2 diabetes (3362)
so we could go through all of the reviews and try
to classify each as one of these 5 groups (group
everything else as some test data)
then try to see which of the test data can be grouped
in the clusters formed by the data expressedly in
the 5 biggest groups

6345 drugs total with 836 conditions

plan
1) make new data set of the 6345 drugs by going through
this data as raw dataset
2) each drug should have the following entries:
        name
        mol mass
        num C
        num H 
        num hetero
        fingerprint (I assume this is a float)
        drug target(s)
        drug group (5 total)
        med. comment length
        med. rating out of 10
        sum of # of people finding reviews helpful*
        
* not entirely sure of this last column
the problem is that the vote for the review being
helpful is tied to the specific review
in any event, the sum will give a measure of how
many other people are reading the drug reviews
who did not make the drug review themselves
so I guess it can be a sort of drug popularity measure
